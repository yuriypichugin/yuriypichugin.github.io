## Board game of life cycles

For the open day of Max Planck Institute, I designed a small board game about different multicellular species competing for dominance. The game is played with duplo pieces and two d4 (tetrahedron) dice.
The rules can be found here: [in English]({{ '/assets/pdf/Outreach/EN-Life_cycles_game.pdf' | relative_url }}) and [in German]({{ '/assets/pdf/Outreach/DE-Life_cycles_game.pdf' | relative_url }})

## Popular science articles

On evolution of multicellularity (article written for popular science project "New principia"):

On COVID-2019 pandemic. At the beginning of 2020, a group of scientists in Max Planck Institute in Ploen started the [website](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/evoltheo_corona/index.html) with information about the virus and the pandemic. I contributed to two articles there:

**Exponential virus growth and increasing the capacity of a healthcare system**: [link](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/evoltheo_corona/articles/AT_CommExpGrowth/01_english/Eng_ExponentiellesWachstum_May.pdf), [pdf]({{ '/assets/pdf/Outreach/Eng_ExponentiellesWachstum_May.pdf' | relative_url }}) 

**Antibody tests and our return to a more normal life**: [link](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/evoltheo_corona/articles/YP_AntibodyTests/index_EN.html), pdf in [English]({{ '/assets/pdf/Outreach/EN-Antibody_tests.pdf' | relative_url }}) and [Russian]({{ '/assets/pdf/Outreach/RU-Antibody_tests.pdf' | relative_url }})
