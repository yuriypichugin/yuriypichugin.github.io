In a metapopulation, direct interactions between individuals are performed only within patches - smaller subpopulations. 
Still, these patches are not isolated as individuals migrate between them. 
Think of an archipelago of islands as an example.
The intensity and the character of migration have an influence on which traits can evolve in such a scenario.
I investigated how various migration modes affect the evolution of cooperation in the metapopulation setting.
