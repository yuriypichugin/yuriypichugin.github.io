The experimental evolution of multicellularity is an actively developing area of research. 
Due to the short generation times of microscopic species, they are capable to evolve fascinating adaptations within a span of a few months.
In this research direction, I work in collaboration with experimentalists and develop models allowing a deeper understanding of empirical findings.
This can be either a toy model, providing a transparent interpretation of observed phenomena, or a more typical data fitting, allowing to distinguish between hypotheses.
