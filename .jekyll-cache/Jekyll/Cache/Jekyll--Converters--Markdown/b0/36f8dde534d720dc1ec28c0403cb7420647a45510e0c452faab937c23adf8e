I"A<p>I am a theoretical biologist studying the evolution of emergent traits. My research focuses on the evolution of multicellularity and simple life cycles: why initially solitary cells formed collectives, why these cells adopted a division of labor, and how the loose cell collectives gained their own identity and became multicellular organisms.</p>

<p>Besides this primary topic, I also contributed to collaborative projects in eco-evolutionary dynamics, evolutionary game theory, and mathematical oncology (which also deals with evolution a lot).</p>

<p>Currently, I am a postdoc in the <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/ctarnita">Tarnita lab</a> at Princeton University.</p>

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com) {:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.)

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
